Vetty Test


First use this cmd to install the flask:  pip install flask

Then, to run the app use this cmd: python app.py

And then, on terminal we get the transfer protocol as: http://127.0.0.1:5000 (this is host and port on which our project runs).

To get the desired files, the endpoint should be like:http://127.0.0.1:5000/readfile,    http://127.0.0.1:5000/readfile/file1.txt,    http://127.0.0.1:5000/readfile/file2.txt,     http://127.0.0.1:5000/readfile/file3.txt
